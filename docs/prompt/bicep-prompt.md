  - Follow Azure naming convention standards for all resource names.
  - Leverage Azure Verified Modules (AVM) where applicable to ensure best practices and consistency.
  - Include a main Bicep file to orchestrate the deployment of all modules.
  - Provide parameterization for environment-specific values such as resource group names, location, and resource tags.
